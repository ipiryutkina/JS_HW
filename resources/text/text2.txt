Whether the weather be fine
Or whether the weather be not
Whether the weather be cold
Or whether the weather be hot...

It's raining
Raining all around...
It's raining puddles
On the ground.
It's raining
On my booted feet.
It's raining
Rivers in the street.
It's raining cats.
It's raining dogs.
It's raining ponds
For polliwogs.
It's raining
Drop by drop by drop ...
A billion trillion...
It won't stop!
It's raining buckets
From the sky.
Don't think the earth
Will EVER dry.


A horse is a horse, of course, of course,
And no one can talk to a horse of course,
That is, of course, unless the horse is the famous Mr.Ed.

The best kind of people are warm and kind
They are always there and they never mind
The best kind of people smile and embrace,
They support you with strength and grace.

because her father was a Catholic, and her father was a Catholic because his mother was
a Catholic, or had been.

"Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the
dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the 
time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. 
Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children." Martin Luther King, Jr.

She sells sea shells at the sea shore,
the shells she sells are the sea-shore shells, I'm sure.

How much wood would a woodchuck chuck
if a woodchuck could chuck wood? 

I miss my Swiss Miss.
My Swiss Miss misses me. 

I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream! 

Whether the weather be fine,
or whether the weather be not.
Whether the weather be cold,
or whether the weather be hot. 
We'll weather the weather 
whether we like it or not.
